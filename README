weird_copy - copy files
=======================
weird_copy is a little, totally serious tool to copy files, written in
totally idiomatic Rust.

It ~~should~~ might work on every system with a POSIX libc and a Rust compiler.

Examples
--------
```sh
% weird_copy /bin/weird_copy /boot/vmlinuz-linux
```
